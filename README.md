# üé¨ Movie Ratings Preprocessing & Similarity Calculation

This project consists of three Python scripts that perform **data filtering**, **ratings normalization**, and **movie similarity calculation** based on user ratings. It processes a movie ratings dataset to prepare it for further analysis or recommendation tasks.

## üìÅ Project Structure

/prefiltering.py ‚Üê Filters movies/users based on number of ratings
/new_ratings.py ‚Üê Normalizes ratings and splits into training/testing sets
/pearson.py ‚Üê Calculates Pearson similarity between movies
/output/ ‚Üê Contains the generated CSVs from each step

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `prefiltering.py`

**Purpose:**  
Filters the dataset to keep only:
- Movies with **at least 5 ratings**
- Users who have given **5 or more ratings**

**What it does:**
- Reads the raw ratings file (CSV format)
- Filters out low-interaction movies and users
- Saves a new filtered CSV file containing:
  - Only movies with ‚â• 5 ratings
  - Only users with ‚â• 5 ratings
- Outputs:
  - 610 users (each with ‚â• 5 ratings)
  - 3650 movies (out of original 9724)

**Output file:**  
`filtered_ratings.csv` (used as input for the next script)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `new_ratings.py`

**Purpose:**  
Normalizes each user's ratings by subtracting their **average rating** from each of their given ratings. Also splits the dataset into **training and testing** sets.

**What it does:**
- Loads the `filtered_ratings.csv` file
- Computes the average rating for each user
- Subtracts the average rating from each user‚Äôs individual ratings
- Splits data into:
  - Training set
  - Testing set
- Saves a new file with normalized ratings containing:
  - `userId`, `movieId`, `new_rating`

**Output file:**  
`normalized_ratings.csv`

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `pearson.py`

**Purpose:**  
Calculates **Pearson correlation similarity** between every pair of movies.

**What it does:**
- Computes similarity between every unique pair of movies using user ratings
- Avoids redundant computations (A vs. B is the same as B vs. A)
- Due to the high computational cost, the final output file is not included, but the script is prepared to generate it

**Note:**  
Running this script on a large dataset may take a significant amount of time due to the number of pairwise comparisons.
